# Syntax Branding

Logos, colours and all that surrounds the Syntax brand.


## Logos

Whenever possible, including on websites - use `Syntax-Logo.png`. This logo is raster based and contains the texture / grunge needed.

If a vector version is need for something like conference conference banners or skateboards, you may use the simplified vector version.

## Colours

``css
:root {
  --yellow: #FABF46;
  --black: #1d1d1d;
}
```
* Note: older version of the logo use #F1C15D yellow, which is slightly less vibrant
