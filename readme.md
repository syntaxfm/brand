## Logos

Whenever possible, including on websites - use `Syntax-Logo.png`. This logo is raster based and contains the texture / grunge needed.

If a vector version is need for something like conference conference banners or skateboards, you may use the simplified vector version.

## Colours

```css
:root {
  --yellow: #FABF46;
  --black: #000;
  --blackish: #1d1d1d;
}
```

**Note:** older version of the logo use #F1C15D yellow, which is slightly less vibrant, so please use the above hex codes instead of using a color picker from an existing logo.

## Fonts

1. The Syntax logo is built with **Radnika Bold**.
2. For text, we haven't settled on anything specific. We do make heavy use of coding fonts for text - Operator Mono, Fira Code, jetbrains mono, Monolisa.
